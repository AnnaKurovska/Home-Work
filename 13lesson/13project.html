        When people make a template module like this one, they almost always start by inventing a special syntax
        for substitutions. For example, they build it so that a string like %%VAR%% is replaced with the value
        of $VAR. Then they realize the need extra formatting, so they put in some special syntax for formatting.
        Then they need a loop, so they invent a loop syntax. Pretty soon they have a new little template language.

                    This approach has two problems: First, their little language is crippled. If you need to do
                    something the author hasn't thought of, you lose. Second: Who wants to learn another language?
                    You already know Perl, so why not use it?
